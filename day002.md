got a new macbook pro. 24gb, 1tb of ram. It has additional ports that should prove useful. I'm trying to decide if I will use the macbook keyboard. Or go ahead and use my mechenical keyboard, also the screen situation. The shared controls for mouse and trackpad are terrible though. I wish they would separate these out. Do i use a separate keyboard or just use the builtin macbook one. I think maybe for a change of pace the mechanical one wouldn't be bad. Biggest issue with the keyboad is that it isn't at the greatest space to use the macbook in open screen mode. And also the screen is bad distance for me. Just using the one sceen is fine i think. I will have to get used to the reversed mousewheel issue.

i think it is the way to go to use my macbook in docked mode with some kind of keyboard. And just see if i can get used to it.
